# TODO

- [ ] Move programming languages to home-manager
- [ ] Import modules with haumea instead of digga lib
- [ ] Reorganize modules to separate ones defining options and ones providing config
  - Move config into global, move global into root?
  - Can do the same for home manager. Put NixOS ones under `nixos`, home manager under `home`?

# Issues pending fixes

- [ ] Home Manager, "`optionsDocBook` is deprecated", https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/issues/4273
